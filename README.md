This is a tensorflow implementation for paper [**Dense Human Body Correspondences Using Convolutional Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05904).

**ATTENTION**: This repo is currently semi-finished, in next few weeks, the newest:
- runnable code with doc
- pretrained AlexFCN parameters
- 3D human model and training tutorial

will be updated.
